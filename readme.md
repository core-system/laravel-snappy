## Snappy PDF/Image Wrapper for Laravel 5 and Lumen 5.1

This package is fork for laravel-snappy package: [https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-snappy](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-snappy). All credits for them ;) 

This package adds ability to set temporary folder for snappy. The reason for that was problem on my produciton server. Where i dont have access to /tmp file, or it is not possible use system temporary folder, whitch is used by Snappy package.
